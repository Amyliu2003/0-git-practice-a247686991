# Git Practice

I found [**Henrik Warne's blog: *Thoughts on programming…***](https://henrikwarne.com/2012/12/12/working-as-a-software-developer/) very interesting. Warne captures the difference between school projects and professional software development. For example, the professional projects are much larger in size, and are evloving forever. Warne’s description of how complexity arises not from individual components but from the interactions between them explains why professional development requires practices like modularization, testing, and careful naming. It highlights the shift from “just writing code” to engineering systems that must survive growth, bugs, and collaboration.

It’s also interesting because Warne emphasizes the human side of software engineering—collaboration, communication, and continuous learning. The advice to read code, work with real tools, and understand that programming is not solitary underscores that being a good developer means more than technical knowledge. 

## Reflections

**Amy Liu:** This article really summarizes the realistic expectations new graduates should have for industry-level developements. I love how it have many bullet points that almost reflect the modular thinking we should have for software engineering. Also love that it provides many resources for future learning!
